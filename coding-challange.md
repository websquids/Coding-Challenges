Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

If you don't have code to share, you can work on our coding challenge described below. 

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

Functional spec
---------------

Prototype **one** of the following projects:

1. Online booking
2. Email Service

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional
features a user might find useful!

### Online booking

Create a service that shows the available slots and gives the user the ability to book one slot only.


### Email Service

Create a service that accepts the necessary information and sends emails. It should provide an abstraction between two different email service providers. If one of the services goes down, your service can quickly failover to a different provider without affecting your customers.

Example Email Providers:

* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html)
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart.html#sending-messages)
* [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/) - [Developer Hub](https://developers.sparkpost.com/)
* [Amazon SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_SendEmail.html)

All listed services are free to try and are pretty painless to sign up for, so please register your own test accounts on each.


Technical spec
--------------

The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end, for instance providing a JSON in/out RESTful API. Feel free to use any other technologies provided that the general client/service architecture is respected.

Choose **one** of the following technical tracks that best suits your skillset:

1. **Full-stack**: include both front-end and back-end.
2. **Back-end track**: include a minimal front-end (e.g. a static view or API docs). Write, document and test your API as if it will be used by other services.
3. **Front-end track**: include a minimal back-end, or use the data service directly. Focus on making the interface as polished as possible.

### Back-end

Use one of the following technologies:
* PHP

You are also free to use one of the the below web frameworks: 
* Laravel
* Lumen

If you choose to use a framework that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

### Front-end

The front-end should ideally be a single page app with a single `index.html` linking to external JS/CSS/etc. You may take this opportunity to demonstrate your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.
You are also free to use one of the the below web frameworks/libraries: 
* React
* Vue.js
* Angular

Host it!
--------
When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.).

How will we review?
